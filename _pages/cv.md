Research Experiences
======
* **Data-driven Intelligent Control** (Jul. 2021 -- Present)

  * Working as a research assistant in the lab of Prof. Hong Cheng ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=-845MAcAAAAJ)). Cooperating with Dr. Zhinan Peng ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9AUL9JEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)) on theoretical research for data-driven, model-free adaptive optimal control design, which is based on **RL** theories and approximate/adaptive dynamic programming (**ADP**). 

  * Recently, a **manuscript** related to proposed robust adaptive controller design is being revised for submission.

* **Value-based Reinforcement Learning** (Dec. 2018 -- Jun. 2021)

  * Conducted a relatively extensive survey on **Deep RL** (e.g., Distributional RL, Variants of DQN, Actor-Critic Methods) and **Transfer/Lifelong RL**. Mainly focused on value-based algorithms.

  * Reproduced QUOTA Algorithm in PyTorch ([Github](https://github.com/Kchu/DeepRL\_PyTorch), **83** stars & **12** forks). 

  * Codes for experiments in pre-print manuscript related to Lifelong RL are available on [Github](https://github.com/Kchu/LifelongRL).

* **Unsupervised Learning** (Aug. 2018 -- Dec. 2018)

  * Conducted a short survey on **Clustering**. Mainly focused on hierarchical clustering algorithms.

  * Reproduced some algorithms, such as CURE ([Matlab](https://github.com/Kchu/CURE-cluster-matlab), [Python](https://github.com/Kchu/CURE-cluster-python)), ROCK ([Matlab](https://github.com/Kchu/ROCK-cluster-matlab)), and Chameleon ([Matlab](https://github.com/Kchu/Chameleon-cluster-matlab)).
