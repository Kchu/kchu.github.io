Research Experiences

* Data-driven Intelligent Control   Jul. 2021 -- Present

Working as a research assistant in the lab of Prof. Hong Cheng (\href{https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=-845MAcAAAAJ}{\emph{Google Scholar}}). Cooperating with Dr. Zhinan Peng (\href{https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9AUL9JEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao}{\emph{Google Scholar}}) on theoretical research for data-driven, model-free adaptive optimal control design, which is based on \textbf{RL} theories and approximate/adaptive dynamic programming (\textbf{ADP}). 

Recently, a \textbf{manuscript} related to proposed robust adaptive controller design is being revised for submission.

* Value-based Reinforcement Learning Dec. 2018 -- Jun. 2021

Conducted a relatively extensive survey on \textbf{Deep RL} (e.g., Distributional RL, Variants of DQN, Actor-Critic Methods) and \textbf{Transfer/Lifelong RL}. Mainly focused on value-based algorithms.

Reproduced QUOTA Algorithm in PyTorch (\href{https://github.com/Kchu/DeepRL\_PyTorch}{\textbf{\emph{Github}}}, \textbf{82} stars \& \textbf{12} forks). Codes for experiments in pre-print manuscript related to Lifelong RL are available on \href{https://github.com/Kchu/LifelongRL}{\textbf{\emph{Github}}}.

* Unsupervised Learning Aug. 2018 -- Dec. 2018

Conducted a short survey on \textbf{Clustering}. Mainly focused on hierarchical clustering algorithms.

Reproduced some algorithms, such as CURE (\href{https://github.com/Kchu/CURE-cluster-matlab}{\emph{Matlab}}, \href{https://github.com/Kchu/CURE-cluster-python}{\emph{Python}}), ROCK (\href{https://github.com/Kchu/ROCK-cluster-matlab}{\emph{Matlab}}), and Chameleon (\href{https://github.com/Kchu/Chameleon-cluster-matlab}{\emph{Matlab}}).
