3nd-year PhD student in Computer Science, University of Hamburg, [Knowledge Technology (WTM)](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/wtm.html) group, advised by [Prof. Stefan Wermter](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/wtm/people/wermter.html).

M.Sc in Computer Science and Technology, [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. William Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=GIwXoWAAAAAJ), 2018-2021.

B.E. in Spatial Information and Digital Technology, [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Fen Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=U0VZ1IkAAAAJ), 2014-2018.

I am deeply interested in the critical methodologies driving Embodied Intelligence, particularly Reinforcement Learning, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Robotics. In humanoid robot development, three key components shape their capabilities: the Brain, the Cerebellum, and the Body. My current research focuses on two of these aspects:

- **Brain** – Leveraging LLMs for planning in long-horizon bimanual robotic tasks.

- **Cerebellum** – Developing bimanual manipulation skills using foundation models.

Through my work, I aim to bridge high-level reasoning and planning with low-level motion control, pushing the boundaries of intelligent robotic systems.

The Future of Embodied Intelligence is Now.
