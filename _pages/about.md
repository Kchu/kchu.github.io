I am a research assistant at the University of Technology and Electronic Science of China (UESTC). I had been awarded my master's degree in Computer Science and Technology at UESTC, supervised by Prof. William Zhu.
 
I mainly engaged in Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Transfer/Lifelong RL during my masterâ€™s study. Recently, our manuscript about Lifelong RL is accepted by the 2021 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC). Currently, I am engaged in the theoretical research for non-model-based, data-driven adaptive optimal control design, which is based on RL theory and approximate/adaptive dynamic programming (ADP). Compared to traditional control methods, learning-based control methods have been attracted extensive attention and can be widely used in practical applications such as robotics and unmanned vehicles.
 
During my studying periods, I have proficiency in programming (Python, Matlab, and C/C++) and Deep Learning frameworks (PyTorch/Tensorflow). I reproduced several Deep RL algorithms with PyTorch and Cluster algorithms with Python/Matlab. While practice is driven by theory, I believe problems in practical applications, such as robotics, and unmanned driving, will promote the vigorous development of theory.

Currently, I am looking for Ph.D. postions! I wish to conduct further research on RL/Robotics in the Real World, which is challenging and forward-looking. Deep RL combines DL's perception ability with the decision-making ability of RL, which is closer to the way of human thinking. Despite the great success of Deep RL, there are still some challenges in the development of RL in the real world, like unavailable reward functions, exploration-exploitation trade-off, out-of-distribution generalization (such as learning knowledge from different domains, applying to new tasks/environments, etc.) and so on. At present, the study about that is immature but promising. With the deepening of research, how to introduce concepts/theories in other fields to solve RL/Robotic problems in reality, including planning/navigation/obstacle avoidance, etc., is an extremely enlightening perspective. In addition, how to further study RL from the perspective of neuroscience is an inevitable way in the future. Reinforcement Learning, as a general learning and decision-making paradigm, will deeply influence Robotics and AI in general.
