2nd-year PhD student in Computer Science, University of Hamburg, [Knowledge Technology (WTM)](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/wtm.html) group, advised by [Prof. Stefan Wermter](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/wtm/people/wermter.html).

M.Sc in Computer Science and Technology, [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. William Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=GIwXoWAAAAAJ), 2018-2021.

B.E. in Spatial Information and Digital Technology, [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Fen Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=U0VZ1IkAAAAJ), 2014-2018.

I have a broad interest in Reinforcement Learning, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Robotics, including 1). how to utilize LLMs to enable RL agents learn more efficiently in (bimanual) robotic tasks; 2). how to employ LLMs in long-horizon robotic tasks; 3) how to deploy learning models (foundation models, RL models) in humanoid robots for everyday tasks in real world, etc.

The Future of Embodied Intelligence is Now.

## What's New

[2024.09] Our paper [Large Language Models for Orchestrating Bimanual Robots](https://labor-agent.github.io/) has been accepted by [Humanoids 2024](https://2024.ieee-humanoids.org/). See you in Nancy, France in November!

[2024.07] Our application to [Researcher Access Program of OpenAI](https://openai.com/form/researcher-access-program/) has been accepted and we have been awarded 5000 USD in API credits!

[2024.03] The project website of [LABOR Agent: Large Language Models for Orchestrating Bimanual Robots](https://labor-agent.github.io/) is released! Paper in arxiv version can be found at [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02018).

[2024.02] I am glad to be served as technical committee member of the 2024 IEEE International Conference on
Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2024) [Workshop on Human-aligned Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Agents and Robots](https://harlworkshop.github.io/index.html).

[2024.02] Our paper **Enhancing Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Large Language Models through Logic** has been accepted at [COLING 2024](https://lrec-coling-2024.org/).

[2023.11] Our paper **Accelerating Reinforcement Learning of Robotic Manipulations via Feedback from Large Language Models** has been accepted as oral presentation at the 7th Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL 2023) [Workshop on Bridging the Gap between Cognitive Science and Robot Learning in the Real World: Progresses and New Directions](https://yantianzha.github.io/crl.github.io/).
