3nd-year PhD student in Computer Science, University of Hamburg, [Knowledge Technology (WTM)](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/wtm.html) group, advised by [Prof. Stefan Wermter](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/wtm/people/wermter.html).

M.Sc in Computer Science and Technology, [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. William Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=GIwXoWAAAAAJ), 2018-2021.

B.E. in Spatial Information and Digital Technology, [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Fen Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=U0VZ1IkAAAAJ), 2014-2018.

I am deeply interested in the critical methodologies driving Embodied Intelligence, particularly Reinforcement Learning, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Robotics. In humanoid robot development, three key components shape their capabilities: the Brain, the Cerebellum, and the Body. My current research focuses on two of these aspects:

- **Brain** – Leveraging LLMs for planning in long-horizon bimanual robotic tasks.

- **Cerebellum** – Developing bimanual manipulation skills using foundation models.

Through my work, I aim to bridge high-level reasoning and planning with low-level motion control, pushing the boundaries of intelligent robotic systems.

The Future of Embodied Intelligence is Now.

## What's New

[2025.10] I'm serving as the reviewer of ICRA 2026 and IUI 2026.

[2025.07] The master student I supervised, Jonas, did a nice oral presentation on IJCNN 2025.

[2025.05] I'm honored to attend [IJCNN 2025](https://2025.ijcnn.org/) this July in Rome, thanks to the generous support of the [IEEE CIS Travel Grant](https://cis.ieee.org/activities/membership-activities/travel-grants). Looking forward to seeing you there!

[2025.04] Our paper, LLM-iTeach: LLM-based Interactive Imitation Learning for Robotic Manipulation, has been accepted for an oral presentation at [IJCNN 2025](https://2025.ijcnn.org/)! Congrats to Jonas on this great achievement!

[2025.03] Our paper, LLM+MAP: Bimanual Robot Task Planning using Large Language Models and Planning Domain Definition Language, is now available online on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17309). Please check the video as well on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/i2j1WyNaBa8?si=NpHR0C8QjHB_cMdg).


[2024.10] We have open-sourced the code for the LABOR Agent on [Github](https://github.com/Kchu/LABOR-Agent).


[2024.09] Our paper [Large Language Models for Orchestrating Bimanual Robots](https://labor-agent.github.io/) has been accepted by [Humanoids 2024](https://2024.ieee-humanoids.org/). See you in Nancy, France in November!

[2024.07] Our application to [Researcher Access Program of OpenAI](https://openai.com/form/researcher-access-program/) has been accepted and we have been awarded 5000 USD in API credits!

[2024.03] The project website of [LABOR Agent: Large Language Models for Orchestrating Bimanual Robots](https://labor-agent.github.io/) is released! Paper in arxiv version can be found at [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02018).

[2024.02] I am glad to be served as technical committee member of the 2024 IEEE International Conference on
Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2024) [Workshop on Human-aligned Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Agents and Robots](https://harlworkshop.github.io/index.html).

[2024.02] Our paper Enhancing Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Large Language Models through Logic has been accepted at [COLING 2024](https://lrec-coling-2024.org/).

[2023.11] Our paper Accelerating Reinforcement Learning of Robotic Manipulations via Feedback from Large Language Models has been accepted as oral presentation at the 7th Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL 2023) [Workshop on Bridging the Gap between Cognitive Science and Robot Learning in the Real World: Progresses and New Directions](https://yantianzha.github.io/crl.github.io/).
